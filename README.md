Revolutionizing Poultry Farming: The Smart Control Cage System
A state-of-the-art technology designed to revolutionize the poultry farming industry and address common problems such as overcrowding, disease outbreaks, and poor welfare of birds.

Features
Temperature control: The system includes a temperature sensor to measure the temperature within the cage. If the temperature falls outside a predefined range, the system activates the fan or bulb to adjust the temperature to the desired level, improving bird welfare and reducing disease risk.

Water level control: The system includes a water level sensor to measure the water level. If the water level falls below a predefined level, the system activates the water motor to refill the water supply, ensuring access to fresh water and preventing water waste.

Feed control: The system includes an ultrasonic sensor to measure the feed level in the feed box. If the feed level falls below a predefined level, the system activates the servo motor to refill the feed box, ensuring access to food and preventing feed waste.

Air Quality control: The system includes an Ammonia (NH4) sensor to measure the level of Ammonia in the air within the cage. If the level of Ammonia exceeds a predefined level, the system activates the ventilation system to improve air quality, ensuring the birds are breathing fresh and clean air and preventing health issues caused by poor air quality.

Benefits
Improved bird welfare
Reduced disease transmission
Increased efficiency
Better living conditions for the chickens
The Smart Control Cage System is the future of poultry farming, providing a more efficient and humane method of poultry farming. The sensors help in monitoring and controlling the environment inside the cage, leading to a better life for the chickens.

Installation
Details on how to install the Smart Control Cage System will be added soon.
