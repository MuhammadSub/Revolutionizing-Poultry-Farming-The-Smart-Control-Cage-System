# Revolutionizing-Poultry-Farming-The-Smart-Control-Cage-System
Revolutionizing Poultry Farming: The Smart Control Cage System:
    A state-of-the-art technology designed to revolutionize the poultry farming industry and address common problems such as overcrowding, disease outbreaks, and poor welfare of birds.

Features:
  1. Temperature control: 
      The system includes a temperature sensor to measure the temperature within the cage. If the temperature falls outside a predefined range, the system activates the fan or bulb to adjust the temperature to the desired level, improving bird welfare and reducing disease risk.

  2. Water level control: 
      The system includes a water level sensor to measure the water level. If the water level falls below a predefined level, the system activates the water motor to refill the water supply, ensuring access to fresh water and preventing water waste.

  3. Feed control: 
      The system includes an ultrasonic sensor to measure the feed level in the feed box. If the feed level falls below a predefined level, the system activates the servo motor to refill the feed box, ensuring access to food and preventing feed waste.

  4. Air Quality control: 
      The system includes an Ammonia (NH4) sensor to measure the level of Ammonia in the air within the cage. If the level of Ammonia exceeds a predefined level, the system activates the ventilation system to improve air quality, ensuring the birds are breathing fresh and clean air and preventing health issues caused by poor air quality.

Methodology:
  1. Sensor selection and implementation:
      1. The DHT11 sensor is for measuring temperature and humidity, allowing for a comfortable
      climate for the chickens.
      2. A water level sensor for monitoring water levels, ensuring the chickens always have access to
      fresh water.
      3. An ultrasonic sensor for measuring the level of feed in a feed box, guaranteeing the chickens
      never go hungry.
      4. An MQ135 sensor for measuring ammonia levels, maintaining a healthy and safe environment
      for the chickens.
  2. Control system:
      Utilize the data collected by the sensors to create a dynamic and responsive environment for the
      poultry, such as:
      1. When the temperature rises, the fan automatically turns on to keep the chickens cool and
      comfortable.
      2. When the temperature drops, the bulb automatically turns on to keep the chickens warm.
      3. If the water level decreases, the water motor automatically starts to refill the water supply,
      ensuring the chickens never go thirsty.
      4. Using the ultrasonic sensor to measure the level of feed in the feed box, when the level is low,
      the servo motor automatically opens the feed box and fills it with feed to ensure the chickens
      always have a bountiful feast.
  3. Data transmission:
      Send the sensor data to a NodeMCU V3 (ESP8266) which can then send the data to a Blynk app for
      monitoring and control purposes, allowing you to always keep an eye on your chickens.
  4. Automation and optimization:
      1. Automate various aspects of the poultry farming process by using the data from the sensors to
      control the environmental conditions and feed levels in the cage system, making your life easier
      and your chickens happier.
      2. Optimize the farming process by using the data from the sensors to adjust the environment and
      feed levels in the cage system for the best possible outcome for the poultry, ensuring your
      chickens thrive.
  5. Evaluation:
      1. Monitor the poultry farming process with the Blynk app, and evaluate the performance of the
      system over time, making improvements as needed.
      2. Adjust as needed to optimize the system and improve the overall outcomes for the poultry,
      ensuring your chickens are living their best lives.

Benefits
  1. Improved bird welfare
  2. Reduced disease transmission
  3. Increased efficiency
  4. Better living conditions for the chickens
